    <h1 class="mspace">about me</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 120%;">i'm an indoor teenager with a liking to computer science and practical electronics</p>
    <br>
    <p>i enjoy solving real-world problems through practical/virtual solutions, wether it's math, code or some kind of system troubleshooting (in which i am <strong>not</strong> good at!)</p>
    <p>i've always been driven by how things work and how to make their parts useful in another context. the combination of technical "skills" and curiosity in myself made me probably always learning and well, evolving</p>
    <p>when i'm not "working" e.g. playing my phone in bed or at school, i make sure that i am learning; like viewing random PDFs and datasheets i left to rot</p>

    <h1 class="mspace">about this website</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 120%;">this website was made as a way for me to communicate to anyone over the internet, or <i>you</i> to know me superficially</p>
    <p>i started this website project on 17th of april 2025 at 1:50 AM, UTC+7. at this time i was trying to come up with a reasonable domain name, one of the first ideas that came up to my mind was "nrdfox.gay" - happy pride month!</p>
    <p>i tried to buy the domain on godaddy and it's quite cheap, but unfortunately for kids like me, a debit card is required to proceed with the transaction. since i dont have one, i've decided to buy the domain when i reached age 17 or when somehow i could borrow a debit card</p>
    <p>i will not update this site daily, i got other works to do, even if they serve zero purpose</p>
    <p>quite to say, i'd rate this site a 5/10, not the best websites in the world and cant even let you know about me very much</p>
    <br>
