    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 120%;">i'm an indoor teenager with a strong passion for computer science and practical electronics.</p>
    <br>
    <p>i enjoy solving real-world problems through practical/virtual solutions, wether it's math, code or system troubleshooting (in which i am <strong>not</strong> good at).</p>
    <p>i've always been driven by how things work and how to make their parts useful in another context. with a mix of technical "skills" and curiosity, i'm constantly learning and evolving.</p>
    <p>when i'm not working e.g. playing my phone in bed or at school, i make sure that i am learning; like checking out chatgpt.</p>
    <br>
    <p>this is me!</p>

    <h1>about this website</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 120%;">this website was made as a way for me to communicate to anyone over the internet, or <i>you</i> to know me superficially.</p>
    <p>i started this website project on 17th of april 2025 at 1:50 AM, UTC+7. at this time i was trying to come up with a reasonable domain name, one of the first ideas that came up to my mind was "nrdfox.gay".</p>

    <h1>Special thanks to:</h1>
    <p><span style="font-size: 120%;" class="orange">Arabitha Muhammad</span> - for being a good friend of mine and having a good personality :)</p>
