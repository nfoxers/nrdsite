    <h1 class="mspace">about this website</h1>
    <p>actually this website doesnt have very much intention and purpose you'd have assumed</p>
    <p>i started this website project on 17th of april 2025 at 1:50 AM, UTC+7. at the time, i was trying to come up with a reasonable domain name and ''one of the first ideas that came up to my mind was "nrdfox.gay". like bro whoa there</p>
    <p>i inevitably tried to buy the domain on godaddy, it's quite cheap! but unfortunately for kids like me, a debit card is required to proceed with the transaction. since i dont have one, i decided to buy the domain when i reached the age of 17 or when somehow i could borrow a debit card</p>
    <p>perhaps i would not update this site daily, i got other things to do, as in reading a 779-page PDF titled "The Lowkey-Keyboard Theory"</p>
    <p>quite to say, i'd rate this site a 5/10, not the best websites in the world and it cant even let you know me very much.</p>
    <br>
