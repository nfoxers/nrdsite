    <h1 class="mspace">about me</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 120%;">i'm an indoor teenager with a strong passion for computer science and practical electronics.</p>
    <br>
    <p>i enjoy solving real-world problems through practical/virtual solutions, wether it's math, code or system troubleshooting (in which i am <strong>not</strong> good at).</p>
    <p>i've always been driven by how things work and how to make their parts useful in another context. with a mix of technical "skills" and curiosity, i'm constantly learning and evolving.</p>
    <p>when i'm not working e.g. playing my phone in bed or at school, i make sure that i am learning; like checking out chatgpt.</p>
    <br>
    <p>this is me!</p>

    <h1 class="mspace">about this website</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 120%;">this website was made as a way for me to communicate to anyone over the internet, or <i>you</i> to know me superficially.</p>
    <p>i started this website project on 17th of april 2025 at 1:50 AM, UTC+7. at this time i was trying to come up with a reasonable domain name, one of the first ideas that came up to my mind was "nrdfox.gay".</p>
    <p>i tried to buy the domain on godaddy, it was very cheap. unfortunately for kids like me, a debit card is required to proceed with the transaction, since i dont have one, i've decided to buy the domain when i reached age 17.</p>
    <p>i will not update this site daily, i got other works to do, even if they serve zero purpose.</p>
    <br>
